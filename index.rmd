Hello! I am a grad student at the University of California - Santa Cruz studying Ecology and Evolutionary Biology - specifically, disease ecology. I'm interested in how changes to the environment create changes in human diseases. I'm currently working on two projects: studying genetically modified organisms in the snail host for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, and monitoring the current SARS-COV-2 epidemic

My current projects are:
