# What is Schistosomiasis?
\newline
Schistosomiasis (pronounced shis-toe-so-my-uh-sis) is a Neglected Tropical Disease - meaning many people don't know about it, and it goes unnoticed and untreated.

It infects 200 million people a year, primarily in Africa, and it causes debilitating symptoms such as cognitive impairment and anemia
