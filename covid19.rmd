Estimating IFRs using New York City data

t_a = Delay from incubation to symptom onset: 6.55 days [Tindale et al.], 3.96 [Du et al.], 5.5 [Lewnard et al.], 6 days [Levin, Cochran & Walsh]

t_b = Delay from symptom onset to antibodies: ~10 days (in 50% of people) [Borremans et al.]

t_c = Delay from symptoms to death: ~13 days [Levin, Cochran & Walsh]

t_d = Delay from death to reported death: 7 days [Levin, Cochran, & Walsh]

t_e = Delay from antibody presentation to reported death: t_c - t_b + t_d = 10 days

Serosurvey midpoint date: April 23

Death date (Serosurvey midpoint date + 10 days): May 3rd

Serosurvey results:
Extrapolated to fit population of NYC 

"[18, 34)",490200
"[35, 45)",270400
"[45, 55)",286700
"[55, Inf)",459000

Number of deaths on May 3rd:

age_class,UC,no_UC,UC_unknown,Total,date
"[-Inf, 18)",6,0,0,6,2020-5-3
"[18, 45)",435,14,89,538,2020-5-3
"[45, 65)",2557,60,356,2973,2020-5-3
"[65, 75)",2490,5,801,3296,2020-5-3
"[75, Inf)",4640,2,1863,6505,2020-5-3


IFRs by combining classes:
"[18, 45)" = (538)/(490200 + 270400) = 0.0007073363 = 0.07%
"[45, Inf)" = (2973 + 3296 + 6505)/(286700 + 459000) = 0.01713021 = 1.7%

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
